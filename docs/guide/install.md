# Installing rafiki

**macOS.** `brew install graveland/tap/rafiki`, then `rafiki setup`.

`brew upgrade rafiki` also applies the upgrade to a machine that already runs the services: it
runs `rafiki service refresh`, which migrates the database, then restarts the daemon and executor
services (interrupting live agents; they recover on restart). Run `rafiki service refresh` yourself
after upgrading any other way. If the migration fails nothing is restarted.

**Self-managed installs** (the `install.sh` route, and source builds) update with
`rafiki upgrade`: it downloads the latest release, verifies its signature against
keys built into the binary, replaces `rafiki` and `rafikid` in place, then runs
`rafiki service refresh`. `rafiki upgrade --check` only reports whether an update
exists; `--version vX.Y.Z` installs a specific tag (the only way to downgrade).
A Homebrew or source install is refused unless you pass `--force`, which installs
a self-managed copy in `~/.local/bin` (and tells you to `brew uninstall rafiki`).
Releases before the first signed one cannot be upgraded this way: re-run
`install.sh`, or `brew upgrade rafiki`, once.

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu).**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/graveland/rafiki/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

That installs `rafiki` and `rafikid` into `~/.local/bin` and runs `rafiki setup`.

**What setup needs:** Docker (or OrbStack) and a Claude login (plus
`ripgrep`/`rg`, which the fundi runtime requires on `PATH`). API keys are
optional.

**What `rafiki setup` does**, in order:

1. Load any saved answers and detect how rafiki was installed.
2. Prerequisites: Docker (or OrbStack) and a logged-in Claude Code.
3. Database: a `rafiki-pg` container, or `--dsn` for a bring-your-own postgres.
4. Migrate the schema.
5. LLM providers: Anthropic / OpenRouter keys, a local Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, written to `providers.toml` (plus optional recall summaries and embeddings).
6. Daemon service, bound to loopback unless you answer yes to network access.
7. Your admin user and profile.
8. The local executor.

`rafiki doctor` checks the daemon, an executor, and one claude agent end to end;
`--agent fundi:<provider/model>` (repeatable) checks a fundi agent on that model
instead or as well.

**Re-running.** Setup is safe to re-run: answers are saved in
`~/.config/rafiki/install.toml`, with secrets (the database DSN and your API
keys) in `service.env`/`executor.env` (0600). `rafiki setup --non-interactive`
replays it with no prompts; without a terminal, setup refuses to run unless that
flag is given.

**Secrets and history.** Passing `--dsn`, `--openrouter-key`, or
`--anthropic-key` on the command line writes those secrets into your shell
history; omit them to answer masked prompts instead, or pre-write `service.env`
yourself.

**The executor alone.** `rafiki executor setup`.
